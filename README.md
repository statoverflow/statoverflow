Use Stack Overflow as a tool to improve your skills as a developer. Identify most challenging topics in your chosen field, view unanswered questions within your area of expertise, and find the most prolific users in your field.

Stretch goal features: Cross reference unofficial Google Trends API to show popularity of relevant terms over time.
