## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Use Stack Overflow as a tool to improve your skills as a developer. Identify most challenging topics in your chosen field, view unanswered questions within your area of expertise, and find the most prolific users in your field.

Stretch goal features: Cross reference unofficial Google Trends API to show popularity of relevant terms over time.

## Getting Started

Once deployed, a user will visit our site to get detailed information within our app.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We are going to be using the JQuery and Handlebars libraries, as well as other server related libraries like pg, express, etc.
